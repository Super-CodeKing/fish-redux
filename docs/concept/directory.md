# Directory

The recommended directory structure would be like this

```
sample_page
    -- action.dart
    -- page.dart
    -- view.dart
    -- effect.dart
    -- reducer.dart
    -- state.dart
    components
        sample_component
        -- action.dart
        -- component.dart
        -- view.dart
        -- effect.dart
        -- reducer.dart
        -- state.dart
```

The upper layer is responsible for assembly and the lower layer is responsible for implementation.
